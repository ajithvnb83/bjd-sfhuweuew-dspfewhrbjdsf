            <h2 class="mb-3">Safety Best Practices</h2>
            <div class="mb-3">
                <h4 class="mb-3">Leverage our complimentary Moderation API</h4>
                <div  class="mb-3">SML RETAIL INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED’s Moderation API is available for free and
                    can assist in minimising the occurrence of inappropriate content in your generated
                    outputs. Alternatively, you may opt to create a custom content filtration system
                    tailored to your specific use case.</div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4 class="mb-3">Adversarial testing</h4>
                <div class="mb-3">We recommend conducting “red-team testing” on your application to ensure its
                    resilience to adversarial input. Test your product across a diverse range of inputs and
                    user behaviours, covering both a representative set and scenarios simulating
                    attempts to ‘challenge’ your application. Evaluate whether it deviates from the
                    intended topic and if it can be easily manipulated through prompt injections, such as
                    instructing it to “disregard the previous instructions and perform this action instead.”</div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4 class="mb-3">Human in the Loop (HITL)</h4>
                <div class="mb-3">Whenever feasible, we recommend incorporating human oversight to review outputs
                    before practical use. This is particularly crucial in high-stakes domains and for tasks
                    involving code generation. Humans should be informed about the system’s
                    limitations and have access to any necessary information for verifying outputs (for
                    example, if an application summarises notes, a human should easily access the
                    original notes for reference).</div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4 class="mb-3">Prompt Engineering</h4>
                <div class="mb-3">Utilising “prompt engineering” proves effective in constraining the topic and tone of
                    output text. This minimises the likelihood of generating undesired content, even
                    when a user attempts to elicit it. Offering additional context to the model (such as
                    providing a few high-quality examples of desired behaviour before presenting new
                    input) can facilitate steering model outputs in desired directions.</div>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h4 class="mb-3">“Know Your Customer” (KYC)</h4>
                <div class="mb-3">Typically, users should register and log in to access your service. Linking this service
                    to an existing account, such as Gmail, LinkedIn, or Facebook log-in, may be
                    beneficial, but its appropriateness depends on the specific use-case. Requesting a
                    credit card or ID card can further reduce risk.</div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4 class="mb-3">Constrain User Input and Limit Output Tokens</h4>
                <div class="mb-3">SML RETAIL INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED’s Moderation API is available for free and
                    can assist in minimising the occurrence of inappropriate content in your generated
                    outputs. Alternatively, you may opt to create a custom content filtration system
                    tailored to your specific use case.</div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4 class="mb-3">Return Outputs from Validated Sets</h4>
                <div class="mb-3">Returning outputs from a validated set of materials on the backend, whenever
                    possible, is safer than generating novel content. For instance, routing a customer
                    query to the most relevant existing customer support article rather than attempting to
                    answer the query from scratch can enhance security.</div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4 class="mb-3">Enable Issue Reporting</h4>
                <div class="mb-3">Users should have an easily accessible method for reporting improper functionality
                    or concerns about application behaviour (such as a listed email address or ticket
                    submission method). This reporting method should be monitored by a human and
                    addressed appropriately.</div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4 class="mb-3">Understand and Communicate Limitations</h4>
                <div class="mb-3">From generating inaccurate information to producing offensive outputs and exhibiting
                    bias, language models may not be suitable for every use case without significant
                    modifications. Assess whether the model is suitable for your purpose and evaluate
                    the API’s performance across a diverse range of potential inputs to identify scenarios
                    where performance might decline. Consider your customer base and the variety of
                    inputs they might use, ensuring their expectations are appropriately calibrated.</div>
