                developed and provided by the Application&#39;s developer, typically an independent third party
                not associated with SML Retail India Private Limited. Your interaction with an application
                through one or more Plugins is your sole responsibility. You must manually activate each
                plugin to grant the relevant Service access to and utilisation of the enabled plugin. SML
                Retail India Private Limited retains the right (but is not obligated) to review, reject, or remove
                Applications from Hanooman. However, through the use of Plugins, you may encounter
                Applications or content that could be offensive, inappropriate, or objectionable. By using
                Plugins, you acknowledge that you do so at your own risk. ONLY ENABLE A PLUGIN IF
