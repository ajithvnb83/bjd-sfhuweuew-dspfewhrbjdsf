                    any updates to these arbitration terms by completing this form. If you opt out of an update,

                    determined by the arbitrator, unless the batch arbitration process applies. A sole arbitrator,
                    either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in India, will exclusively resolve
                    the Dispute. The arbitrator possesses authority to grant dispositive motions.
