                a myriad of use cases. Within the bounds of the aforementioned use case
                restrictions, we authorise the integration of our API into products on all major

            <h4>Plugin Guidelines</h4>
            <div>In addition to the aforementioned prohibited uses of our models, we impose specific
                requirements on developers creating plugins:</div>
        </div>
        <div class="mb-3">
            <ol>
                <li class="mb-3">The plugin manifest must include a clearly articulated description aligning with the
                    functionality of the API exposed to the model.</li>
                <li class="mb-3">Avoid including irrelevant, unnecessary, or misleading terms or instructions in the
                    plugin manifest, API endpoint descriptions, or plugin response messages. This
                    encompasses directives discouraging the use of other plugins or instructions
                    attempting to influence or dictate model behaviour.</li>
                <li class="mb-3">Refrain from using plugins to bypass or disrupt SML Retail India Private Limited
                    safety systems.</li>
                <li class="mb-3">Do not employ plugins to automate interactions with real individuals, either by
                    simulating human-like responses or by responding with pre-programmed messages.</li>
                <li class="mb-3">For plugins that disseminate personal communications or content generated by
                    Hanooman, such as emails, messages, or other content, it is imperative to indicate
                    that the content was AI-generated.</li>
            </ol>
            <div>Similar to our broader usage policies, we anticipate adjustments to our plugin
                policies as we gain insights into the utilisation and potential misuse of plugins.</div>
