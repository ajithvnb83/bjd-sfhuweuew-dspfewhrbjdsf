            <h2 class="mb-3">Service Credit Terms</h2>
            <div class="mb-3">
                These Terms, referred to as the SML RETAIL INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED-Service
                Credit Terms, constitute an agreement between you and SML RETAIL INDIA
                PRIVATE LIMITED (or our affiliates), governing the acquisition, receipt, or utilization
                of any credit applicable to our Services (“Service Credit”). Capitalized terms not
                defined in these Terms are as per the meanings set forth in the agreement between
                you and SML RETAIL INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED, which regulates your usage of the
                relevant Services (the “Agreement”).
            </div>
            <div class="mb-3">
                We may provide the option to prepay for specific Services by acquiring credits
                (“Prepaid Service Credits”). These Prepaid Service Credits represent the amount
                paid in advance for the corresponding Services, and additional terms may apply to
                specific Services.
            </div>
            <div class="mb-3">
                Furthermore, we may offer Service Credits at no cost as part of a promotional
                program (“Promo Service Credits”). Promo Service Credits are not applied against
                any transaction-based taxes that may be applicable to you.
            </div>
            <div class="mb-3">It is important to note that Service Credits are not legal tender, currency, or
                redeemable for money. They are not refundable, exchangeable, or equivalent to fiat
                currency. Service Credits do not substitute for fiat currency and do not grant any
                personal property rights. Non-transferable, Service Credits can only be used in
                connection with the relevant Service.</div>
            <div class="mb-3">
                All sales of Services, including prepaid Services, are final, and Service Credits are
                non-refundable. If unused, they expire one year after purchase or issuance unless
                otherwise specified at the time of purchase.
            </div>
            <div class="mb-3">
                Your SML RETAIL INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED account will display your available
                Service Credit balance, and you are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the
                credits added to or deducted from your balance. Your Service Credit balance is not
                akin to a bank account, digital wallet, stored value account, or any form of payment
                device.
            </div>
            <div class="mb-3">
                Any attempted transfers, sales, gifts, or trades of Service Credits are prohibited and
                unrecognized. Such attempts violate these Terms and may result in the revocation,
                termination, or cancellation of Service Credits and/or your use of the Services. This
                could lead to immediate suspension or termination of your account without refund.
            </div>
            <div class="mb-3">
                In accordance with the Agreement and applicable law, we reserve the right to
                suspend or terminate your use of the Services, including the suspension or
                termination of your Service Credit balance.
            </div>
            <div class="mb-3">These Terms may be modified at any time, and the revised version will be posted on
                our website or emailed to the associated email address. The modified Terms become
                effective upon posting or, if notified by email, as indicated in the email message. By
                receiving or using any Service Credit after the effective date of a modification, you
                agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</div>
